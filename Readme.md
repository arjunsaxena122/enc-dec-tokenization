# Project Overview â€” How AI Reads User Input via Tokenization

- First, the user enters their thoughts as text.

- Then, the AI breaks this text into several numbers because the system can only understand binary data.

- This process is called encoded tokenization.

- If you want to check the numbers behind a message, you can also perform decoded tokenization to convert the tokens back into readable text.
